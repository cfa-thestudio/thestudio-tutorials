== Steps

Two powerful tools, the Admin GUI and Manager GUI, provide convenient
ways to manage, configure, and monitor your Tomcat server and its
deployed applications.

=== Admin GUI

The Admin GUI is a comprehensive interface designed for server-wide
administration and configuration. It allows system administrators and
advanced users to have fine-grained control over various aspects of the
Tomcat server. By accessing the Admin GUI, you can perform tasks such
as:

* Viewing and modifying server status and information.
* Managing server configuration files.
* Setting up server logging and monitoring.
* Managing user authentication.

=== Manager GUI

The Manager GUI is a focused interface designed to manage individual web
applications deployed on the Tomcat server. It offers developers and
application administrators an easy way to perform various
application-level management tasks. With the Manager GUI, you can:

* Deploy new web applications to the Tomcat server.
* Undeploy or remove existing applications.
* Start, stop, and reload application.
* Monitor application status, sessions, and resource usage.
* Access application logs and perform diagnostics.

To access both the Admin GUI and the Manager GUI, you will need
appropriate administrative credentials defined in a file inside
`+tomcat/conf+` called `+tomcat-users.xml+`. As part of your
configuration process, you will define users and assign them the
necessary roles and permissions to access these two interfaces.

. Navigate to the `+tomcat/conf+` directory and open the
`+tomcat-users.xml+` file.
+
The `+tomcat-users.xml+` file is used for configuring users and roles in
Apache Tomcat. It allows you to define authentication credentials and
assign specific roles to control access to different functionalities and
components of Tomcat. You need to create those roles.
. At the bottom of the file, you will find something similar to this
commented piece of code.
+
[source,xml]
----
<!--
<role rolename="tomcat"/>
<role rolename="role1"/>
<user username="tomcat" password="<must-be-changed>" roles="tomcat"/>
<user username="both" password="<must-be-changed>" roles="tomcat,role1"/>
<user username="role1" password="<must-be-changed>" roles="role1"/>
-->
----
. Uncomment and change it to something like the following:
+
[source,xml]
----
<role rolename="admin-gui"/>
<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
<user username="io" password="1234" roles="manager-gui, admin-gui"/>
----

* The first two lines define two roles, "`admin-gui`" and
"`manager-gui`". These roles are typically associated with the Tomcat
Manager GUI and Admin GUI, respectively. Remember: roles determine the
permissions and access levels for different users.
* The last line defines a user with the username "`io`" and the password
"`1234`".
* The user is assigned both the "`admin-gui`" and "`manager-gui`" roles,
which means they have access to both the Admin GUI and Manager GUI of
Tomcat.
* This user will be able to perform administrative tasks and manage
applications using these interfaces.

. Start Tomcat by executing the `+startup.sh+` script.

. Open the browser at `+localhost:8080+` to check that Tomcat is
successfully running. You should see a page similar to this one.

For information on the status of the Tomcat server or about the web
applications that are deployed there, you can click on "`Server Status`"
or "`Manager App`". It will prompt you to insert your credentials, which
are the ones you configured in the `+tomcat-users.xml+` file.

If you need to restart Tomcat, run the `+shutdown.sh+` script, followed
by `+startup.sh+`.
