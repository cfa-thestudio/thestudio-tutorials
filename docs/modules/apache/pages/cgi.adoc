= Running CGI Programs on Apache

To get your CGI programs to work properly, you must have Apache
configured to permit CGI execution.

== Configure Apache Server

=== Steps

[arabic]
. Locate the Apache server configuration file and open it in Vim.

* Arch Linux or Manjaro
+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
----
* Ubuntu/Debian
+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo vim /etc/apache2/conf-available/cgi-bin.conf
----
* macOS
+
[source,bash]
----
$ vim /opt/homebrew/etc/httpd/httpd.conf
----

[arabic, start=2]
. Enable CGI modules in Apache.
+
NOTE: The configuration for Ubuntu is slightly different. If you use this
OS, skip the next 3 steps.
+
In Apache, two modules enable the server to execute CGI:

* `+mod_cgid+` is typically used when you expect to handle a large
number of concurrent CGI requests — it uses a single process to handle
multiple requests reducing the overhead of process creation (however, it
is a little bit more complex to configure).
* `+mod_cgi+` is suitable for lower loads — each invocation creates a
new process, which can lead to higher resource usage and slower
performance when dealing with high-traffic websites.
+
These modules execute CGI scripts and handle communication between the
web server and the scripts. Enabling them is essential for Apache to
handle CGI scripts properly. Choose one depending on your website’s
specific requirements.
+
In the configuration file, locate the following lines:
+
* Arch Linux or Manjaro
+
[source,bash]
----
#LoadModule cgid_module modules/mod_cgid.so
#LoadModule cgi_module modules/mod_cgi.so
----
+
* macOS
+
[source,bash]
----
#LoadModule cgid_module lib/httpd/modules/mod_cgid.so
#LoadModule cgi_module lib/httpd/modules/mod_cgi.so
----
+
NOTE: Press `+/+` to start searching within a vim document.
+
Depending on your website’s specific requirements, uncomment either of
these lines by removing the `+#+` at the beginning of it. When making
this decision, you should evaluate whether simplicity outweighs
performance concerns in your website.
+
In this example, uncomment `+cgid+` module.

[arabic, start=3]
. Map a URL path to the CGI scripts directory
+
The `+ScriptAlias+` directive lets you map a URL path to a specific
directory where CGI scripts reside. Locate the `+ScriptAlias+` section
in the configuration file and add a line similar to the following to map
a URL path to a directory containing CGI scripts:

* Arch Linux or Manjaro
+
....
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/srv/http/cgi-bin/"
....

* macOS
+
....
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/opt/homebrew/var/www/cgi-bin/"
....
+
The examples above map the URL path `+/cgi-bin/+` to a physical
directory. The Apache web server treats files inside that directory as
CGI scripts.
+
NOTE: When you install Apache, the `+cgi-bin+` directory’s default location
is the path described in the `+ScriptAlias+` directive. In the example
above, it is `+/srv/http/cgi-bin/+`. If the directory is not there, you
can create it by navigating to `+/srv/http/+` and
running `+sudo mkdir cgi-bin+`.

[arabic, start=4]
. Enable the execution of CGI scripts and associate `+.sh+` files as CGI
scripts by modifying the directory configuration.

* Add the `++ExecCGI+` option to allow the execution of CGI scripts.
* Add an `+AddHandler+` directive to associate the `+.sh+` file
extension with the CGI script handler, indicating that files with this
extension should be treated as CGI scripts.
* In the configuration file, find the section that starts
with `+<Directory+`. This section defines the configuration options for
the `+cgi-bin+` directory, which is the default location for CGI
scripts.
* Within the `+<Directory>+` block, locate the following lines:
+
....
AllowOverride None
Options None
Require all granted
....
* Modify those lines to the new configuration:
+
....
Options +ExecCGI
AddHandler cgi-script .sh
Require all granted
....
* Save and exit the text editor.

=== Ubuntu/Debian Configuration

Add the following lines to the `+cgi-bin.conf+` file to enable CGI
modules; define a `+ScriptAlias+` to map a URL path to the CGI scripts
directory; and add some options to enable the execution of CGI scripts
and associate `+.sh+` files as CGI scripts in that directory.

....
<IfModule mod_alias.c>
    <IfModule mod_cgi.c>
        Define ENABLE_USR_LIB_CGI_BIN
    </IfModule>

    <IfModule mod_cgid.c>
        Define ENABLE_USR_LIB_CGI_BIN
    </IfModule>

    <IfDefine ENABLE_USR_LIB_CGI_BIN>
        ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /var/www/html/cgi-bin/
        <Directory "/var/www/html/cgi-bin">
            AllowOverride None
            Options +ExecCGI
            AddHandler cgi-script .sh
            Require all granted
        </Directory>
    </IfDefine>
</IfModule>
....

Save and exit the text editor.

NOTE: Since you are defining a new directory to run CGI scripts from, you
must navigate to `+/var/www/html+` and create a new directory by running
`+sudo mkdir cgi-bin+`

== Create a CGI Shell Script

You can use just about any programming language to serve dynamic content
using CGI. In this example, you will use a simple shell script to
illustrate how CGI works. You will use CGI with a simple shell script to
generate dynamic HTML pages on the fly. Let’s go through the steps to
create a simple shell script:

[arabic]
. Inside the `+cgi-bin+` directory, create a file called, say,
`+script.sh+` and open it to start writing.
. Start the script with the shebang line `+#!/bin/sh+`. This line tells
the operating system to execute the script using the Bourne shell
interpreter.
. Write the necessary commands in the script to generate the desired
HTML content. Here’s an example shell script that sends an HTML response
with "`Hello, world!`":
+
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/sh

# set the Content-Type header
echo "Content-Type: text/html"
echo ""

# output the HTML response
echo "<html>"
echo "<head>"
echo "<title>Hello</title>"
echo "</head>"
echo "<body>"
echo "<h1>Hello, world!</h1>"
echo "</body>"
echo "</html>"
----
. Save and exit the text editor.

== File Permissions

Remember that the server does not run as your user. When the server
starts up, it runs with the permissions of an unprivileged user —usually
called `+http+` or `+www+` — and so it will need extra permissions to
execute files you own.

Usually, the way to give a file sufficient permissions to be executed
by the server is to give your user execution permission for the file:

[source,bash]
----
$ chown www:www script.sh
$ chmod u+x script.sh
----

`+chown+` changes the owner, and `+chmod+` changes permissions. Update
these commands to match the user, group, and CGI script to run.

You can check the user and group under which the Apache server runs:

* Arch Linux or Manjaro
+
Open `+httpd.conf+` (`+/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf+`) and search for
these lines:
+
[source,bash]
----
User www
Group www
----
* Ubuntu/Debian
+
Open `+envvars+` (`+/etc/apache2/envvars+`) and search for these
variables:
+
[source,bash]
----
export APACHE_RUN_USER=www-data
export APACHE_RUN_GROUP=www-data
----
* macOS
+
Open `+httpd.conf+` (`+/opt/homebrew/etc/httpd/httpd.conf+`) and search
for these lines:
+
[source,bash]
----
User _www
Group _www
----

== Restart Apache Server

* Arch Linux or Manjaro
+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo systemctl restart httpd
----

* Ubuntu/Debian
+
Use `+a2enconf+` Apache script to enable the new `+cgi-bin+`
configuration before restarting:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo a2enconf cgi-bin
$ systemctl restart apache2
----
* macOS
+
[source,bash]
----
$ brew services restart httpd
----

Access your script via the browser with the appropriate URL to verify
that it generates the expected HTML output — in this case,
`+http://localhost/cgi-bin/script.sh+`.
