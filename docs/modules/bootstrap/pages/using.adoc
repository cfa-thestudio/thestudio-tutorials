:navtitle: Using Bootstrap

Now that Bootstrap is added to your project, let’s learn how to actually *use* it to build pages quickly.  
The goal isn’t to memorize every class — it’s to understand how Bootstrap helps you layout and style your HTML using simple, reusable class names.

== 1. Start with a Container

Most Bootstrap pages start with a container — it gives your content proper spacing and alignment.

[source,html]
----
<div class="container">
  <h1 class="mt-4 text-center text-primary">Welcome to Bootstrap</h1>
  <p class="lead text-center">A quick way to style your pages with clean, responsive design.</p>
</div>
----

You’ll see classes like `container`, `mt-4`, and `text-center`.  
Bootstrap uses these small utility classes for spacing (`m` for margin, `p` for padding) and alignment (`text-center`, `text-start`, etc.).  

NOTE: You’ll start recognizing patterns — Bootstrap’s naming system is very consistent.

== 2. Build a Layout with the Grid System

Bootstrap’s grid is the heart of its layout system.  
You place elements inside `.row` and `.col` containers — and Bootstrap handles the sizing and responsiveness.

[source,html]
----
<div class="container mt-4">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <div class="p-3 bg-light border rounded">Left side</div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <div class="p-3 bg-light border rounded">Right side</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
----

Here’s how it works:

* `.row` creates a horizontal group of columns.
* `.col-md-6` makes two equal columns on medium screens (≥768px) and larger.
* On smaller screens, columns automatically stack vertically — no extra code needed!

== 3. Add Some Components

Bootstrap includes ready-to-use building blocks like buttons, alerts, and cards.  
You can drop them right into your HTML and combine them with layout classes.

[source,html]
----
<div class="container mt-4">
  <h2>Common Components</h2>

  <button class="btn btn-primary">Primary Button</button>
  <button class="btn btn-outline-secondary">Outline Button</button>

  <div class="alert alert-success mt-3" role="alert">
    This is a success alert — it uses color and spacing built into Bootstrap.
  </div>

  <div class="card mt-4" style="width: 18rem;">
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/286x180" class="card-img-top" alt="Example image">
    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">Example Card</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Cards group related content in a clean layout.</p>
      <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Learn more</a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
----

== 4. Think in Classes, Not Custom CSS

The key idea with Bootstrap is:  
instead of writing your own CSS right away, see if a Bootstrap class already does what you need.

.Examples of Common Utility Classes
[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Want to... | Use this class

| Add margin
| `m-3`, `mt-4`, `mb-2`

| Add padding
| `p-3`, `py-2`

| Center text
| `text-center`

| Round corners
| `rounded`

| Make something full width
| `w-100`

| Change text color
| `text-danger`, `text-success`

| Change background color
| `bg-light`, `bg-dark`, `bg-primary`
|===


These utilities are like shortcuts — combine them freely.

== 5. Understanding Class Names

Bootstrap class names often follow a pattern:

`{property}{side?}-{size?}` 

Example:  
`mt-4` = margin-top, spacing size 4  
`py-2` = padding top & bottom (y-axis), spacing size 2

Breakpoints add responsiveness:

col-md-6 → column 6 units wide on medium (≥768px) screens and up

You can change how things behave at different screen sizes by swapping `sm`, `md`, `lg`, etc.

== 6. Learn More and Explore

You don’t need to memorize everything — Bootstrap’s documentation is your friend.  

* https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/[Official Docs, window=_blank]
* https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/[Example Gallery, window=_blank]

TIP: When you find a design you like in the docs, right-click → “Inspect” — you’ll see which classes they used. Copy, tweak, and learn from it!

== Practice

As a quick exercise, try building a simple layout:

* A container with a centered heading  
* Two columns (`col-md-6`) with cards inside  
* Add spacing and colors using Bootstrap utility classes  

No CSS file needed — just Bootstrap and a little HTML!
