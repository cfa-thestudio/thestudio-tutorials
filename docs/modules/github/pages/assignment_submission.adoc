To submit an assignment using Git, follow the steps below:

Open your command line or terminal.

Navigate to your desktop using the `cd` command. For example, if your desktop path is `~/desktop`, enter the following command:
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/desktop
----

Change into the cloned repository's directory.
   Run the command:
[source,bash]
----
cd <your_repo_url>
----

Create a new branch for your submission.
   Execute the following command:
[source,bash]
----
git branch learner
----

Add your assignment files to the repository.
Use the following command to add all files and directories:
[source,bash]
----
git add .
----

Commit your changes with a descriptive message about the changes you made.
Replace `<small_message>` with a concise summary of your changes.
Run the command:
[source,bash]
----
git commit -m "<small_message>"
----

Push your branch to the remote repository.
Use the following command:
[source,bash]
----
git push origin
----

Once you have completed these steps, your assignment will be submitted.
Notify your instructor or project coordinator about your submission, providing them with any necessary details or instructions they require.

Remember to review any submission guidelines provided by your instructor or project coordinator, as they may have additional instructions or requirements specific to your assignment.
