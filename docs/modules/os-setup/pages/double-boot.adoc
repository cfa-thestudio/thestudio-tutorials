= Installing Ubuntu With Windows in Dual-Boot
:imagesdir: ../images
:figure-caption!:
:last-update-label!:

Most users are accustomed to computers running a single operating
system, be it Windows, macOS, or one of the Linux distributions. But you
may have heard of computers running two or more different operating
systems. The process of installing two or more operating systems on the
same computer and being able to choose which one to boot is called
dual-booting or multi-booting.

This process is complex, so read this tutorial carefully first. Keep in
mind that this tutorial addresses only the dual-booting part of this
process.

For information on installing Ubuntu, go to
https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#5-installation-setup[https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#5-installation-setup, window=_blank];
open these installation instructions on a separate gadget or print them
out because you might not have access to them on the computer where
you’ll be setting up your double-boot.

== Requirements

* A computer running Windows 10 or 11
* Processor (CPU): Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5
* Memory (RAM): 8 GB or more
* Storage (SSD): 512 GB or more (at least 30 GB available)
* BIOS in UEFI mode (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)
* External hard drive to back up your data
* 8+ GB Flash Drive

== Steps

=== 1 | Check the specifications of your computer

[arabic]
. Search for the “System Information“ app and open it.
. On the “OS Name“ line, check the operating system installed.
. On “Processor“, check your computer’s CPU.
. On “Installed Physical Memory (RAM)“, check your computer’s RAM.
. On “BIOS Mode“, check if it is UEFI.
+
.BIOS mode is UEFI
image::check-UEFI.png[BIOS mode is UEFI, 90%]
+
. On “Secure Boot State“, check if it is On.
. Close this app.
. Press the Windows key to open the “Start“ menu.
. Open “Settings“ (⚙️ icon).
. Go to “System“ and select “Storage“.
. Check the drives on your computer and how much space is available and
being used.

=== 2 | Create a temporary backup

The backup is optional, but doing it is a good idea as you will be
modifying your current Windows installation and may accidentally lose
some of your data.

[arabic]
. Press the Windows key to open the “Start“ menu.
. Search for the “Control Panel“ app and open it.
. Click on “System and Security“.
+
.Windows Control Panel
image::control-panel.png[Windows Control Panel, 90%]
+
. Click on “Backup and Restore (Windows 7)“.
. On the left panel, click on “Create a system image“.
+
.Create a system image
image::create-system-image.png[Create a system image, 90%]
+
. Select the external hard drive where you want to save the full backup
and click on “Next“.
+
.Save the backup
image::save-backup.png[Save the backup, 90%]
+
. Confirm your backup settings. This window provides information about
the backup location, the amount of disk space that will be used by the
backup, and any drives that will be backed up. Click on “Start
backup“; this may take a while.
+
.Confirm the backup settings
image::confirm-backup-settings.png[Confirm the backup settings, 90%]
+
. Click on “Close“ when the backup is complete.

=== 3 | Create a bootable flash drive

A bootable flash drive is a disk that can be used to boot a system to
install an operating system.

[arabic]
. Go to https://ubuntu.com/#download[https://ubuntu.com/#download, window=_blank] and download Ubuntu by clicking on
the “Get Ubuntu Desktop“ button.
+
.Download Ubuntu
image::get-ubuntu-desktop.png[Download Ubuntu, 90%]
+
We recommend the LTS version because of the longer support option.
+
When the download is finished, go to the Downloads folder and confirm
that you have downloaded the file `ubuntu-22.04.desktop-amd64`.
. Go to https://etcher.balena.io/[https://etcher.balena.io/, window=_blank] and click on “Download Etcher“. You
will use Etcher to create a bootable USB flash drive, by transferring
the disk image containing Ubuntu to your USB flash drive.
. Install and launch Etcher.
. Make sure your USB drive is plugged into your computer.
. In the Etcher app, choose “Flash from file“.
+
.Start Etcher
image::etcher-flash.png[Start Etcher, 90%]
. A window will appear allowing you to select the Ubuntu ISO you have
downloaded. Click “Open“.
+
.Select the Ubuntu image
image::etcher-choose-file.png[Select the Ubuntu image, 90%]
. Back in Etcher, click on “Select target“. A window will appear and
you should see your USB flash drive there.
+
.Etch the image with Ubuntu
image::select-target.png[Etch the image with Ubuntu, 90%]
. Tick the box and click “Select“.
. Click on “Flash“. The computer may ask if you want to allow the
Etcher app to make changes to your device, click “Yes“. This process
might take some time, depending on the speed of your USB flash drive.
. After it’s done flashing it, Etcher will validate it.
. Close Etcher.

=== 4 | Create free space for Ubuntu

You need to create a separate partition for a second operating system on
your hard drive. You can also just use a second hard drive if you’ve got
one.

[arabic]
. In the Windows search bar, type “disk partitions“, and you’ll get
the option “Create and format disk partitions“ in the Control panel.
Click “Open“.
. This Disk Management window shows all the connected drives.
+
.In this image, a drive called Disk 0 has three partitions. Your drive may have a different name.
image::disk-management-window.png[In this image, a drive called Disk 0 has three partitions. Your drive may have a different name., 90%]
+
In this image, a drive called Disk 0 has three partitions. Your drive
may have a different name.
+
Partition 0 is the EFI partition with a capacity of 260MB (these values
may be different on your computer).
+
Partition 4 is the recovery partition with a capacity of 1000MB.
+
NOTE: Do NOT meddle with partitions 1 and 4, EFI and Recovery: you need to
retain the ability to restore Windows in case something goes wrong.

.Read more about these partitions.
[%collapsible%]
====
The EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface) is a special partition on your
computer’s hard disk or solid-state drive (SSD) that is used to store
files essential to the system’s boot process. The EFI partition contains
the bootloader files needed to initialise the computer and load the
operating system. These files include the Windows Boot Manager or other
boot loaders, depending on the operating systems installed on the
computer. If you have more than one operating system installed on your
computer (e.g. Windows and Ubuntu, as you are about to do), each
operating system will have its own boot loader stored in the EFI
partition.

Partition 4 is the recovery partition. It contains the tools and files
needed to troubleshoot, repair or recover the operating system in the
event of a problem or failure. You will not touch partitions 1 and 4,
EFI and Recovery, to remain able to restore Windows in case something
goes wrong.
====

The Windows SDD partition, which is usually labelled `C:`, is the
primary location for the Windows operating system, programs, data and
other files needed for your computer to run. This is the partition we
are going to shrink to make room for the Ubuntu installation. There are
several steps to this process.

[arabic, start=3]
. Select the Windows partition and right-click. If you’ve got more than
one hard drive, make sure you select the one you want to dual-boot
Ubuntu to.

. Select “Shrink Volume“ from the drop-down menu.
+
.Shrink volume
image::shrink-volume.png[Shrink volume, 90%]
+
. Windows will check the available space for shrinking.
+
.Windows queries the shrink space
image::querying-shrink-space.png[Windows queries the shrink space, 90%]
+
. Enter the amount of space to shrink in MB.
+
.Specify the shrink space
image::available-shrink-space.png[Specify the shrink space, 90%]
+
The amount you insert here is the amount of space that will be
subtracted from the Windows partition. You may notice that in this
example the amount of available shrink space (37768 MB) is much smaller
than the free space on the disk (169.18 GB). This is due to the location
of some unmovable files. Windows has certain unmovable system files
(such as the page file, hibernation file, and others) that are located
at the end of the drive. These files cannot be moved, so the maximum
amount you can shrink the partition is limited by the space needed to
keep these files in their current locations.
+
If you don’t have enough available shrink space, here are some steps you
can take:

* Delete all unnecessary files (remember to move them to an external
drive first, if you want to keep them).

* Uninstall unused programs.

* Use Windows Disk Cleanup.

** Open File Explorer.

** Right-click on your C drive (or any other drive you want to clean)
and select “Properties“.

** On the General tab, click on “Disk Cleanup“.

** Select the types of files you want to delete (e.g. temporary files,
recycle bin), then click “OK“ and confirm the deletion.

.We recommend at least 35-50GB so that you can safely install the programs you’ll need for this course and save your code.
[%collapsible%]
====
You may have noticed that the Ubuntu website states that you need a
laptop or PC with at least 25GB of free disk space, but we recommend
more. Besides, you don’t want to allocate all your space to Ubuntu. The
Windows side will still need space for updates, temporary files, general
system maintenance and other personal files you may want or need to
create, so consider this when entering the amount of space to shrink.
. When you decide the amount you want to shrink, click on “Shrink“.
This operation may take a while.
. When the shrinking is done, you will have a new unallocated partition
on your hard drive. You will allocate this space when you install
Ubuntu.

=== 5 | Dual-booting

Now you need to access BIOS to change the boot priority so that the
bootable Ubuntu USB flash drive you created earlier is the first to
boot.

Before you do this, make sure to google the correct key or combination
of keys on your keyboard to access the BIOS. The most common keys are
F2, F12, Esc, Del, or a combination of these, and will vary depending on
the make and/or model of your computer.

[arabic]
. Make sure the bootable flash drive is plugged into your computer.
. Shut down and restart your computer. While it’s starting up, press the
key or key combination (that can be Fn + F2 if you have a Lenovo laptop)
repeatedly. You may need to try this a few times before it works.
. This will take you to the BIOS settings of your computer. Look for
instructions on how to navigate the BIOS settings and perform changes on
each screen.
. You want to change the boot priority in the BIOS. Navigate to the Boot
(or Boot Priority) tab. There, you will find your available devices.
. Select your bootable USB flash drive. Make sure you select the correct
device if you have more than one.
. Move the selected device to the top of the list, so it will be the
first to boot. Check on the current screen for instructions on how to
move the selected device.
. Save the changes and exit (check your interface on how to do this).
You may need to wait a few minutes.
. You are now ready to install Ubuntu. The black GNU GRUB menu will
appear, with a few options. Note that there is an automatic timeout, so
if you don’t select anything, it will default to the first option, which
is “Try or Install Ubuntu“. If you have an NVidia video card, choose
“Ubuntu (safe graphics)“.
. After a few moments, you will see a screen with two options: “Try
Ubuntu“ or “Install Ubuntu“. Choose “Install Ubuntu“.
. From this point on, follow the Ubuntu tutorial:
https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#5-installation-setup[https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#5-installation-setup, window=_blank].
