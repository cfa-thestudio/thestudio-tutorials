:navtitle: Importing Bootstrap

You can add Bootstrap to your project using a **CDN** or by **downloading locally**.

== Include via CDN

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of servers distributed around the world that delivers files (like CSS, JavaScript, or images) to users from the server closest to them. Using a CDN for Bootstrap means your website can load the framework’s files faster, reduce server load, and benefit from automatic updates and caching.

You can add the following `+<link>+` and `+<script>+` elements: 

[source,html]
----
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" defer></script>
----

NOTE: defer ensures scripts load after the HTML

== Download Locally

1. Go to https://getbootstrap.com  
2. Download the compiled CSS and JS files.  
3. Place them in your project’s `css/` and `js/` folders.  
4. Link them in your HTML files.
