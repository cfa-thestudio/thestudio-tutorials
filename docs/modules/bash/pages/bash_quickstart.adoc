= Bash Quick Start Tutorial

== the steps

=== 1 | Open a Terminal

Launch a terminal application on your operating system. In Linux and macOS, you can typically find a terminal in the system's applications or utilities.

=== 2 | Basic Commands

Once the terminal is open, you can start entering commands. Here are some basic commands to get you started:

- `ls`: List files and directories in the current directory.
- `cd`: Change directory. Use `cd <directory>` to navigate to a specific directory.
- `mkdir`: Create a new directory. Use `mkdir <directory>` to create a directory with a specific name.
- `echo`: Display text on the terminal. For example, `echo "Hello, world!"` will print "Hello, world!".

Try running these commands to familiarize yourself with the basics of Bash.

=== 3 | File Operations

Bash allows you to perform various file operations. Here are a few commands to work with files:

- `touch`: Create an empty file. Use `touch <filename>` to create a file with a specific name.
- `cp`: Copy files. Use `cp <source> <destination>` to copy a file from the source path to the destination path.
- `mv`: Move or rename files. Use `mv <source> <destination>` to move or rename a file.
- `rm`: Remove files. Use `rm <filename>` to delete a file.

Experiment with these commands to create, copy, move, and delete files.

=== 4 | Shell Scripting

Bash is not just a command interpreter; it is also a scripting language. You can create shell scripts to automate tasks and perform more complex operations. Follow these  to create a simple shell script:

Open a text editor and create a new file with a `.sh` extension (e.g., `myscript.sh`).

Add the following lines to the file:
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, world!"
----

Save the file and exit the text editor.

To run the shell script, navigate to the directory where the script is located and execute the following command:
[source,bash]
----
bash myscript.sh
----

The script will output "Hello, world!" on the terminal.
