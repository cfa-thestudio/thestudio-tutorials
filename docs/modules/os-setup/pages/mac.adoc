You will install all the necessary software using your Terminal and the Homebrew package manager.

[arabic]
. Check if Homebrew is installed:

[source,bash]
----
$ brew -v
----

Where `brew` is the name of the software package manager and `-v` is the
version.

You should have the following output:

[source,bash]
----
Homebrew 4.1.11
----

`4.1.11` is the version; yours can be different.

Or install:

In case you don’t have Homebrew installed, copy and paste the following
command into your terminal:

[source,bash]
----
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
----

[arabic]
. To install any application with Homebrew, run this command:

[source,bash]
----
$ brew install <package_name>
----

Where `<package_name>` identifies the software you want to install.

You can find the relationship between the software and the correspondent
command in the following table:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|software |command
|Git |brew install git
|Visual Studio Code |brew install –cask visual-studio-code
|Node.js |brew install node
|JDK 17 |brew install openjdk@17
|IntelliJ Idea |brew install –cask intellij-idea
|Ant |brew install ant
|Maven |brew install maven
|Postman |brew install –cask postman
|PostgreSQL |brew install postgresql@15
|Tomcat |brew install tomcat@10
|Zoom |brew install –cask zoom
|===

NOTE: The `--cask` option is used with the `brew` command to interact with
casks. They are part of Homebrew’s package management system and are
specifically designed for installing GUI applications and other
non-command-line software on Mac.

Use each command, one at a time, to install all the software you will need in this course.

NOTE: Netcat already comes pre-installed on macOS.
