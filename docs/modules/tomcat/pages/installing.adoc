== the steps

=== Install Tomcat

[arabic]
. Download the core binary distribution (`apache-tomcat-10.1.10.tar.gz`) of Tomcat from https://tomcat.apache.org/download-10.cgi[https://tomcat.apache.org/download-10.cgi].

. In your terminal, use the `tar` command to unzip the file you downloaded.
+
.Assuming the current directory is `/home/learner`
[source,bash]
----
$ tar zxvf Downloads/apache-tomcat-10.1.10.tar.gz
----
+
`zxvf` are options passed to the `tar` command:
+
* `z` specifies that the archive is compressed using gzip +
* `x` tells `tar` to extract the contents of the archive +
* `v` stands for "verbose" and enables the command to display detailed output +
* `f` indicates that the next argument is the filename of the archive to be processed
    
. Move the newly created file (`apache-tomcat-10.1.10`) to somewhere you won't forget.
+
.Assuming the current directory is `/home/learner``
[source,bash]
----
$ mkdir utilities
$ mv Downloads/apache-tomcat-10.1.10 utilities
----
    
. Create a soft link to don’t have to write `apache-tomcat-10.1.10` every time you want to refer to it.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cd utilities
$ ln -s apache-tomcat-10.1.10 tomcat

=== Configuring and Running Tomcat

There are two powerful tools that provide convenient ways to manage, 
configure, and monitor your Tomcat server and its deployed applications: 
the Admin GUI and Manager GUI.

_Admin GUI_

The Admin GUI is a comprehensive interface designed for server-wide administration 
and configuration. It allows system administrators and advanced users to have 
fine-grained control over various aspects of the Tomcat server. By accessing 
the Admin GUI, you can perform tasks such as:

* Viewing and modifying server status and information
* Managing server configuration files
* Setting up server logging and monitoring
* Managing user authentication

_Manager GUI_

The Manager GUI is a focused interface specifically designed for managing 
individual web applications deployed on the Tomcat server. It offers developers 
and application administrators an easy way to perform various application-level 
management tasks. With the Manager GUI, you can:

. Deploy new web applications to the Tomcat server
. Undeploy or remove existing applications
. Start, stop, and reload application
. Monitor application status, sessions, and resource usage
. Access application logs and perform diagnostics

To access both the Admin GUI and the Manager GUI, you will need appropriate 
administrative credentials defined in a file inside `tomcat/conf` called 
`tomcat-users.xml`. As part of your configuration process, you will 
define users and assign them the necessary roles and permissions to access these two interfaces.

[arabic]

. Navigate to the `tomcat/conf` directory and open the `tomcat-users.xml` file.
+
The `tomcat-users.xml` file is used for configuring users and roles in Apache Tomcat. 
It allows you to define authentication credentials and assign specific roles to control 
access to different functionalities and components of Tomcat. So let's create those roles.
    
. At the bottom of the file, you will find something similar to this commented piece of code.
+   
[source,xml]
----
<!--
<role rolename="tomcat"/>
<role rolename="role1"/>
<user username="tomcat" password="<must-be-changed>" roles="tomcat"/>
<user username="both" password="<must-be-changed>" roles="tomcat,role1"/>
<user username="role1" password="<must-be-changed>" roles="role1"/>
-->
----  

. Uncomment and change it to the following:
+
[source,xml]
----
<role rolename="admin-gui"/>
<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
<user username="andre" password="1234" roles="manager-gui, admin-gui"/>
----
+
* The first two lines define two roles, "admin-gui" and "manager-gui". These roles are typically associated with the Tomcat Manager GUI and Admin GUI, respectively. Remember: roles determine the permissions and access levels for different users.
+
* The last line defines a user with the username "andre" and the password "1234".
+
* The user is assigned both the "admin-gui" and "manager-gui" roles, which means they have access to both the Admin GUI and Manager GUI of Tomcat.
+
* This user will be able to perform administrative tasks and manage applications using these interfaces.

. Start Tomcat by executing the `startup.sh` script.
+
.Assuming the current directory is `/home/learner/utilities/tomcat``
[source,bash]
----
$ bin/startup.sh
Using CATALINA_BASE:   /home/learner/utilities/tomcat
Using CATALINA_HOME:   /home/learner/utilities/tomcat
Using CATALINA_TMPDIR: /home/learner/utilities/tomcat/temp
Using JRE_HOME:        /usr
Using CLASSPATH:       /home/learner/utilities/tomcat/bin/bootstrap.jar:/home/learner/utilities/tomcat/bin/tomcat-juli.jar
Using CATALINA_OPTS:
Tomcat started.
----

. Open the browser at `localhost:8080` to check that Tomcat is 
successfully running. You should see a page similar to this one:
+
.Tomcat homepage
image::tomcat-homepage.png[Tomcat homepage]
+
For information on the status of the Tomcat server or about the web applications 
that are deployed there, you can click on “Server Status” or “Manager App”. 
It will prompt you to insert your credentials, which are the ones you 
configured in the `tomcat-users.xml`` file.
+
[cols=".>a,.>a", frame=none, grid=none]

| .Manager App page

+
If you need to restart Tomcat, run the `shutdown.sh` script, followed by `startup.sh`.
+
