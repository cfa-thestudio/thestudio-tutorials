:navtitle: Importing Bootstrap

You can add Bootstrap to your project using a **CDN** or by **downloading locally**.

== Include via CDN

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of servers distributed around the world that delivers files (like CSS, JavaScript, or images) to users from the server closest to them. Using a CDN for Bootstrap means your website can load the framework’s files faster, reduce server load, and benefit from automatic updates and caching.

To use Bootstrap via CDN, you need to include:

* The **CSS `<link>`** in the `<head>` section of your HTML, so styles are applied as the page loads.
* The **JS `<script>`** at the end of the `<body>` section (or use `defer` in the `<head>`), so interactive components like modals, dropdowns, and tooltips work correctly.



[source,html]
----
<!-- In the <head> -->
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.8/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

<!-- Before closing </body> or in <head> with defer -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.8/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" defer></script>
----

NOTE: Using `defer` ensures that the JavaScript is executed only after the HTML has been fully parsed, preventing errors if scripts try to access elements that haven’t loaded yet.

== Download Locally

You can either **download the compiled files manually** or **install Bootstrap via npm** if you're using a build tool.

=== Manual Download

1. Go to https://getbootstrap.com[window=_blank]  
2. Download the compiled CSS and JS files.  
3. Place them in your project folders, for example:

[start=4]
. Link the files in your HTML. Make sure your **custom CSS** comes *after* Bootstrap, and your **custom JS** comes *after* Bootstrap’s bundle, so overrides and scripts work correctly:

[source,html]
----
<!-- In the <head> -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/bootstrap.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/custom.css">

<!-- Before closing </body> -->
<script src="js/bootstrap.bundle.js" defer></script>
<script src="js/index.js" defer></script>
----

=== Using npm

`npm` (Node Package Manager) is a tool that lets you install, manage, and update JavaScript libraries and packages, including Bootstrap. It comes bundled with Node.js and is widely used in modern web development workflows.

NOTE: If you're working with a modern JavaScript project using a build tool or module bundler (like Vite, Webpack, or Parcel), you can install Bootstrap via npm instead of downloading the files manually. Other package manager options are available https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/download/#package-managers[here, window=_blank].
