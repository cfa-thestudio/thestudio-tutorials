:navtitle: Using Bootstrap

Now that Bootstrap is added to your project, let’s go beyond setup and understand *how to think and work* with it.  
Bootstrap is more than just a collection of styles — it’s a way of building responsive, consistent layouts using simple class names.

We’ll start by understanding how Bootstrap’s classes and patterns work, then apply them to real examples.

== Understanding How Bootstrap Works

Before diving into building layouts, let’s look at the ideas behind Bootstrap — containers, utility classes, and naming patterns.  
Once you understand these, everything else in Bootstrap becomes much easier.

=== Containers and Basic Structure

Most Bootstrap layouts start with a **container**.  
It centers your content and adds consistent horizontal padding, so everything lines up neatly on different screen sizes.

[source,html]
----
<div class="container">
  <h1 class="mt-4 text-center text-primary">Welcome to Bootstrap</h1>
  <p class="lead text-center">A quick way to style your pages with clean, responsive design.</p>
</div>
----

Here, classes like `mt-4` (margin top), `text-center`, and `text-primary` show how Bootstrap uses short, readable names to apply spacing, alignment, and color.

NOTE: You’ll start to recognize patterns — Bootstrap’s class naming is designed to be consistent and guessable.

=== Thinking in Classes, Not CSS

With Bootstrap, you often don’t need to write your own CSS right away.  
Instead, you describe what you want using **utility classes** — small, single-purpose helpers for spacing, colors, alignment, and more.

Examples of Common Utility Classes:
[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Want to... | Use this class

| Add margin
| `m-3`, `mt-4`, `mb-2`

| Add padding
| `p-3`, `py-2`

| Center text
| `text-center`

| Round corners
| `rounded`

| Make something full width
| `w-100`

| Change text color
| `text-danger`, `text-success`

| Change background color
| `bg-light`, `bg-dark`, `bg-primary`
|===

These classes act like shortcuts — combine them freely to get the spacing and style you need without touching a CSS file.

=== Understanding Class Names and Breakpoints

Bootstrap’s utility class system follows a simple pattern:
`{property}{side?}-{size?}`

Examples:

* `mt-4` → margin-top, spacing size 4  
* `py-2` → padding top & bottom (y-axis), spacing size 2  

For responsive layouts, Bootstrap adds *breakpoints* such as `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and so on.  
They represent screen sizes where the layout changes:

[cols="1,1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Breakpoint | Width | Example usage

| `sm`
| ≥576px
| Small devices (phones)

| `md`
| ≥768px
| Medium devices (tablets)

| `lg`
| ≥992px
| Large devices (laptops)

| `xl`
| ≥1200px
| Extra large (desktops)
|===

Example:  
`col-md-6` means the element takes up half the width (6 columns) on medium screens and larger — and becomes full width on smaller screens.  
See the <<Working_with_the_Grid_System,Working with the Grid System>> section for more on how the grid divides rows into 12 columns and handles responsive layouts.

== Applying Bootstrap in Layouts

Now that you understand the building blocks, let’s use them to create responsive layouts and reusable components.

=== Working with the Grid System

The **grid system** is one of Bootstrap’s most useful features for creating responsive layouts. 
Bootstrap’s grid system divides each row into **12 equal columns**, and you specify how many columns an element should span using classes like `col-6` (half width) or `col-4` (one third width). 
Columns automatically resize and stack on smaller screens, and multiple columns in a row will wrap as needed if their total exceeds 12.

You place content inside `.row` and `.col` containers, and Bootstrap automatically handles the layout across screen sizes.

[source,html]
----
<div class="container mt-4">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <div class="p-3 bg-light border rounded">Left side</div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <div class="p-3 bg-light border rounded">Right side</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
----

What’s happening here:

* `.row` creates a horizontal group of columns.  
* `.col-md-6` makes each column take up half the row on medium screens and larger, and full width on smaller screens.  
* You can mix and match column widths, stack them on smaller screens, and nest rows for more complex layouts — all without writing custom CSS.

NOTE: Despite being called a “grid,” Bootstrap’s grid system is based on **Flexbox**, not CSS Grid (`display: grid`). 
It still uses rows and columns like a grid, but under the hood, `.row` uses `display: flex` to handle layout and responsiveness.


=== Adding Components

Bootstrap includes ready-made **components** like buttons, alerts, and cards.  
They’re designed to work well together and follow consistent styling.

[source,html]
----
<div class="container mt-4">
  <h2>Common Components</h2>

  <button class="btn btn-primary">Primary Button</button>
  <button class="btn btn-outline-secondary">Outline Button</button>

  <div class="alert alert-success mt-3" role="alert">
    This is a success alert — it uses color and spacing built into Bootstrap.
  </div>

  <div class="card mt-4" style="width: 18rem;">
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/286x180" class="card-img-top" alt="Example image">
    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">Example Card</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Cards group related content in a clean layout.</p>
      <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Learn more</a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
----

=== Adding Interactivity with Bootstrap JavaScript

Bootstrap isn’t just about styling — it also includes built-in JavaScript to make components interactive.  
You’ve already added the Bootstrap JS bundle in the setup step (with `<script>`), so these features are ready to use.

With that in place, you can add interactivity to your HTML using simple `data-bs-*` attributes — no custom JavaScript needed.

For example, here’s a button that shows a dismissible alert:

[source,html]
----
<div class="container mt-4">
  <h2>Interactive Example</h2>

  <!-- Button trigger -->
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-warning" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#demoModal">
    Show Message
  </button>

  <!-- Modal -->
  <div class="modal fade" id="demoModal" tabindex="-1" aria-labelledby="demoModalLabel" aria-hidden="true">
    <div class="modal-dialog">
      <div class="modal-content">
        <div class="modal-header">
          <h5 class="modal-title" id="demoModalLabel">Heads up!</h5>
          <button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"></button>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
          This popup works thanks to Bootstrap’s built-in JavaScript — no custom code needed!
        </div>
        <div class="modal-footer">
          <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-bs-dismiss="modal">Close</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
----

Here’s what’s happening:

* The `data-bs-toggle="modal"` attribute tells Bootstrap this button will trigger a modal.  
* The `data-bs-target="#demoModal"` attribute specifies which modal element to show.  
* The modal itself uses classes like `.fade` (for a smooth transition) and `.modal-dialog`/`.modal-content` to structure the popup.  
* The buttons inside the modal use `data-bs-dismiss="modal"` to close it — no custom JavaScript needed.  
* Since you already included the Bootstrap JS bundle in the setup step, all of this works automatically.

NOTE: You can use the same pattern for other interactive components like dropdowns, tooltips, and collapses. Bootstrap handles the behavior for you via `data-bs-*` attributes.
